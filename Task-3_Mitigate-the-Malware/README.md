****Task 3: Mitigate the Malware Attack****  

Using the patterns you’ve identified, use Python to write a firewall rule to technically mitigate the malware from spreading.  

****Background Information****  

Work with the networks team to implement a firewall rule using the Python scripting language. Python is a common scripting language used across both offensive and defensive information security tasks.  

In this task, we will simulate the firewall’s scripting language by using an HTTP Server. You can assume this HTTP Server has no computational requirements and has the sole purpose of filtering incoming traffic.  

In the `/resources` folder, you will find a test script that you can use to simulate malicious requests to the server.  

You can check out the Readme file in the starter codebase for more information on how to get started.  

****Task****  

- Use Python to develop a firewall rule to mitigate the attack.  
- Develop this rule in `firewall_server.py` and only upload this file back here.  
- Use `test_requests.py` to test your code while the firewall HTTP server is running.  

****Deliverable****  
- The primary script: `firewall_server.py`  
- This script implements a basic HTTP firewall that blocks malicious requests based on predefined signatures.  

****Resources****  
- The `/resources` folder contains:  
  - `test_requests.py` – A script to test the firewall by sending simulated attack payloads.  
  - `base_firewall.py` – The original firewall script before modifications.  

****Helpful Documentation****  
- [http.server — HTTP servers — Python 3.12.3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)  

****Solution****  
- Running the base `firewall_server.py` script and executing the `test_requests.py` script to observe the firewall's behavior.

- Modifying `firewall_server.py` to block any detection of the **Spring4Shell** exploit and validating the firewall rule using `test_requests.py`.
